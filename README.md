# Fig3d : Interactive 3D figures

Certain scientific manuscripts have figures that show 3D objects as a limited number of 3D views, like:

<b>Figure 1:</b> (panel A) example of a simplified 3D model based on the logo of Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste. (panel B) Fig3d allows for multiple panels, just like manuscript figures!<br></br>

Fig3d allows for an interactive Figure of 3D objects arranged in panels and accompanied captions. Its rendering is simple and is based on the excellent [Stl Viewer Javascript Plugin](https://www.viewstl.com/plugin/). The previous figure (as appears in PDF, online, etc) can be viewed within the browser window, as shown below:

For example, [here](https://download2.grid.elettra.trieste.it/prox_8t4H3EybKLeTZAhSTDXZPUYylfwnxidd/Elettra3D_logo/Elettra3D_logo_v3/rawdata/fig3D_elettra/) you can find the interactive Fig3d of the Elettra logo!

The main advantage of Fig3D is a specialised web based Wizard that given a caption and a 3D Object (ie. .stl) generates the corresponding standalone interactive 3D figure that requires no special servers or software to run (just a web browser). It is also encouraged that it is included as a hyperlink, ideally with its own DOI to the manuscript's figure. The file may be hosted on standard scientific data repos.
